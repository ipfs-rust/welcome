    2. sled (Joonas + David)
    3. Proposal: Move on with simple file storage
    4. David - Currently a trait in rust-ipld that we can use inside rust-ipfs
3. Bitswap
    1. Rudiger linked https://blog.ipfs.io/2020-02-14-improved-bitswap-for-container-distribution/
    2. How to store the blockstore ledger
    3. Proposal to assume honest nodes and keep altruistic strategy

5. Start date 2020-03-02 on, maybe a call on 2020-03-02 or 2020-03-03
6. Overall, async comms Preferred
7. Rust IPFS History
    1. Build for Parity
    2. Now working on Rust-IPLD for package chain like Nix but using IPFS
    3. Lots of potential for package managers and build systems
    4. Problems with bitswam from game theoretical standpoint, working on that
    5. Working on Hashgraph implementation
    6. Flutter-rs. Rust on Android.
8. Ideas for IPFS improvement
    1. FUSE Filesystem and Gateway
        1. This means they optimize for gateway by caching
        2. FUSE is slow
        3. This is what unixfs v2 _might_ be
    2. Bitswap
        1. https://github.com/ipfs/research-bitswap/issues/12
        2. Works well a _small_ number of _honest_ nodes 
        3. Large swarm of dishonest nodes = recipe for trouble
9. Ended on time
